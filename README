Small test of fast communication between STM32F4 and ICE40 using the STM32 FSMC.

Pinout for the FSMC:

  func  STM32  ICE40
  A0    PF0    E14
  D0	PD14   F15
  NE2	PG9    G15
  NOE	PD4    H14
  NWE	PD5    F14

The external clock for the ICE40 is on J3. A test pin PF11 on the
STM32F4 is connected to P16 on the ICE40.
