Small test of fast communication between STM32F4 and ICE40 using the STM32 FSMC.

Pinout for the FSMC:

  func  STM32  ICE40
  A0    PF0    E14
  A1    PF1    H16
  D0	PD14   F15
  D1	PD15   F16
  D2	PD0    G16
  NE2	PG9    G15
  NOE	PD4    H14
  NWE	PD5    F14

The external clock for the ICE40 is on J3. A test pin PF11 on the
STM32F4 is connected to P16 on the ICE40. A serial Tx out from STM32
can be connected from PA2 on the STM32F4 board to J14 on the ICE40
(will be proxied to the FTDI on the ICE40 breakout board).
